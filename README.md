# Original Assignment Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

# Roadmap
A few key features are not yet working.  Ideally the timer would have multiple functions based on incorrect answers, quiz completion, and time running out.
Local storage is not currently coded to record initials and high scores.

# Authors and acknowledgement
During creation, I have referenced many sites.  Mostly W3Schools, stackoverflow.com, and freeCodeCamp.org
